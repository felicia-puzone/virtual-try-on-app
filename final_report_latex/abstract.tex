\textit{Our project will be focusing on designing a 2D image-based virtual try on system. Virtual try on consists in generating an image of a reference person wearing a given try-on garment. This kind of problem is usually solved with a two-stage approach,  incorporating at least both a geometric transformation module to warp the selected garment and a generative try-on module to reconstruct the realistic try-on image given the person representation and the warped cloth.
We propose a complete pipeline built on this system performing in-the-wild virtual-try-on, consisting in image enhancing, background removal, a content-based retrieval system, cloth warping \& try-on and a final super-resolution upscaling based on StableDiffusion.}

\textit{The Warping and Try-On networks are trained by us through the DressCode dataset provided by Unimore. Substantial effort was put into dataset preprocessing and network adaptation. Moreover, our generative network was provided with a transformer-based block for establishing global mutual dependencies between the cloth and the person representations.
We trained both our transformer-based generative module and another similar module and compared the outputs on a common test set, with results demonstrating better performances for the former.}
