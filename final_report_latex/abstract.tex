\textit{Questo abstract non mi convince del tutto, bisogna riscriverlo.}
Our project will be focusing on designing a 2D image-based virtual try on system. Virtual try on consists in generating an image of a reference person wearing a given try-on garment. This kind of problem has been widely investigated due to its relevance in the fashion market. VTON is also interesting as it is a challenging problem requiring a multi-layered approach incorporating at least both a geometric transformation module to warp the selected garment and a generative try-on module that creates the realistic try-on images.

The project also includes a content-based retrieval system: given a worn cloth, the system extracts descriptors from the picture and finds similar items from a repository.

\textit{Quest'ultima frase Ã¨ da rivedere, alla luce di quello che ci disse il tutor.}
The objective of the project will be for the system to more easily adapt to not as professional and noisier photos.
